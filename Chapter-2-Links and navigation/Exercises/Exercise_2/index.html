        <p>
            Haru Yoshioka is a shy and quiet high school girl. One day she saves a cat from being run over but it turns out to be Prince Lune a prince of the Kingdom of Cats. As a form of gratitude cats from the kingdom began offering her gifts and proposing a marriage to the Prince to which Haru unknowingly agreed. 
Haru was encouraged by a mysterious voice to seek out Muta, a large white cat, who could guide her to the Cat Bureau to get help from Baron Humber von Gikkingen a cat figurine who was given life by his creator, and Toto a stone raven.
Haru and Muta are taken to the Kingdom of Cats, leaving the Baron and Toto behind in the human world. While in the Kingdom of Cats, the king hosts a banquet and Haru is treated like royalty but Haru begins to have cat-like traits, as a result of losing her human self in the kingdom. As part of the entertainment the Baron in disguise dances with Haru and advises her to rediscover her true self, and with the help of Yuki, a royal cat maiden, they manage to escape the castle.
As they are escaping the Kingdom of the Cats they face a series of obstacles set by the Cat King, but Haru and her friends still manage to climb up the tower. The Cat King manages to corner them, but then Prince Lune intervenes. Prince Lune finds out what his father did and confesses that he wants to propose to Yuki.
Haru finds out that Yuki is the mysterious voice that guided her to see Muta and reveals that she was the kitten Haru fed when she was a young girl. After rejecting the King's proposal, Haru, Muta, and the Baron escape with the help of Prince Lune and Yuki.
In the end, Haru rediscovers her true self, and the Baron reassures her that if she has a problem the Cat Bureau will always welcome her. After her adventures and back to the human world, Haru displays newfound self-confidence and finds her true self.

        <p>
            I really like this film, it tells a story of a girl who can speak to cats, one day she saves one that just so happens to be a prince of a 
            land of similar cats, a land where they talk, and act like humans (tbh the coincidence of that is astronomical) the main character Haru 
            is entitled to marry the king, but after a scuffle, she tries to escape. I love the Baron, he’s cool and I’ve always loved a protagonist who’s
            like that, finishes a situation but isn’t bothered afterward. The other characters aren’t as strong as the main 3, and the adventure isn’t as 
            good as others which is jarring for studio Ghibli. Though it’s really charming, and I love the concept! It’s still such a great, memorable film, 
            and to be honest I love it just as any other person. 3.9/5 not as strong as other studio Ghibli projects, and not as great of a family film in my 
            opinion, but still a fantastic heartwarming piece.

            So I chose to watch this movie because it had cats as the star of the show. How could I resist?
            However, I was not expecting the delightful and funny ride that this movie turned out to be!  
            Not only is the whole movie idea fun, but the characters are adorable and the ending so heartwarming.  
            I feel like this movie is great for adults and kids alike. It’s a great watch for only a movie that’s 
            a little over an hour. I enjoyed watching it and would probably buy it to own as a comfort movie.
