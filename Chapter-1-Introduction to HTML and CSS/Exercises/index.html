            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the pasta al dente or 1 minute shy of cooking instructions.</li>
                <li>Reserve ½ cup of pasta water and drain.</li>
                <li> While the pasta is cooking, in a large pan, sauté the garlic on medium heat with olive oil. </li>
                <li>Once the garlic has slightly softened, add the gochujang paste.</li>
                <li>Lower the heat and cook the gochujang out to mellow some of the spice. The oil should turn into a beautiful red hue.</li>
                <li>Add heavy cream and mix to combine the sauce. Turn the heat back on to medium and simmer the sauce until it's reduced to half the original amount.</li>
                <li> Add the cooked pasta and the pasta water. Simmer until the sauce has coagulated and starts sticking onto the pasta.</li>
                <li> Add the shrimp and stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Turn the heat to low, add parmesan and finish the pasta with butter. This helps the sauce stay glossy. </li>
                <li> Optionally, finish with chives / Italian parsley / little more olive oil. Plate. Garnish with more grated parmesan.</li>
